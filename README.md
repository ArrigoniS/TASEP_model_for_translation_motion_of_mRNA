# TASEP_model_for_translation_motion_of_mRNA
This repository contains my Bachelor's thesis, in which I studied the translational motion of mRNA during protein synthesis using a new Python module called TASEPy, developed by Luca Ciandrini, Associate Professor at the University of Montpellier and member of the Institut Universitaire de France.
